# Material CMS

**Material CMS** is a fork of the ASP.NET MVC 5 C# open source content management framework [MrCMS](https://www.mrcms.com)

Material CMS wraps up a lot of the time consuming aspects of website creation. Material CMS is a framework for developers create bespoke website whilst at the same time giving content editors an easy to use CMS.

Road map:

*   [Material Design](https://material.google.com/) for Default theme and admin area
*   Better multi-languages support for both backend and frontend
*   Create more useful apps
*   Add more elegant and ready-to-use themes
*   Installation which allows to setup quickly for different kinds of websites
*   Frequently update and better support

## Apps
Apps in Material CMS contain all the functionality your website requires. For example, you might want a Blog App which contains page definitions for a list of blogs and a blog page itself. 

Material CMS comes with 3 basic apps, 'Core', 'Articles' and 'Galleries'. The CoreApp contains basic concepts such as login and registration. It also has some basic page types such as 'TextPage' which can be used as a base page type for other pages.

Ultimately though, you can throw these three apps out and start building your own if you want.
